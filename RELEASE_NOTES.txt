UserAndJobState repo

OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
A service for 1) maintaining global KBase user state, and 2) maintaining
job state. See the API docs for more details.

VERSION: 0.0.2 (Released TBD)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- Share jobs with another user.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- N/A

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- None

KNOWN BUGS: 
In some cases, the server can start up, apparently normally, without
establishing contact with MongoDB. In this case all calls will fail, and the
server should be restarted. This *appears* to only occur once per magellean
instance, which makes it difficult to debug.

To check whether this has occurred:

# cd /kb/deployment/lib/
# python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from biokbase.userandjobstate.client import UserAndJobState
>>> ujs = UserAndJobState('http://localhost:7083', user_id='[username]',
	password='[pwd]')
>>> ujs.create_job()
u'525c7bb0e4b0ade4bb6a6593'

The above call will fail if the server has started incorrectly.
