UserAndJobState repo

OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
A service for 1) maintaining global KBase user state, and 2) maintaining
job state. See the API docs for more details.


VERSION: 0.1.1 (7/29/2014)
--------------------------------------
Hotfix release to update Auth jar to most recent version with 60 day token
lifetimes.

VERSION: 0.1.0 (7/24/2014)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- Can now get the status of and share Awe jobs by providing the Awe
  job ID rather than an UJS job ID; the UJS service must be set up to
  communicate with an Awe server for this functionality to be enabled.
    - the UJS service and description fields are populated from the Awe job
      document info.service and info.description fields.
- Extended results data structure allowing more flexibility in defining
  results locations.
- UJS jobs are now auto-deleted after 6 months rather than 1.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- N/A

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- Delete Awe jobs
- Report client stdout/stderr on suspended jobs if available
- get Awe service list
- get Awe job owners / shared lists
- listing jobs currently has a hardcoded limit of 1000 for Awe jobs. This
  needs a yet to be determined fix.
- Linking Awe and UJS jobs

VERSION: 0.0.5 (7/7/2014)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- Client now has a method to deactivate SSL certification validation
  (primarily for use with self-signed certs)

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- fixed a bug where incoming timestamps could intermittently be reported as
  invalid when they're correctly formatted
- service user is now configurable in the deploy-upstart target
- date strings now may contain 'Z' for the timezone
- there is now an option in deploy.cfg to specify the number of times to
  attempt to contact MongoDB on startup

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:

KNOWN BUGS: 
In some cases, the server can start up, apparently normally, without
establishing contact with MongoDB. In this case all calls will fail, and the
server should be restarted. This *appears* to only occur once per magellean
instance, which makes it difficult to debug.

To check whether this has occurred:

# cd /kb/deployment/lib/
# python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from biokbase.userandjobstate.client import UserAndJobState
>>> ujs = UserAndJobState('http://localhost:7083', user_id='[username]',
	password='[pwd]')
>>> ujs.create_job()
u'525c7bb0e4b0ade4bb6a6593'

The above call will fail if the server has started incorrectly.

VERSION: 0.0.1 (Released 10/14/2013)

- First release.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- N/A

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
